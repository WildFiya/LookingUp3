<div id="about"> 

<br>
Looking Up is here to provide practical ways to infuse your life with positivity
on a daily basis. 
When life gets hard or just extremely busy, losing our center and sometimes our cool 
is a slippery slope. 
Or maybe, times have gotten so hard it feels like you can't see the light and all the 
self-help options are overwhleming. Looking Up is here 
to offer friendly suggestions that anyone can do to shift the 
energy and recreate avenues of happiness and fulfillment. <br><br>
Just remember ... when you get that haunting feeling that sits in the pit of your stomach
... and frustration creeps up ... and that unworthy and in-lack auto 
response kicks in ... remember that you don't have to feel that way.

    <br><h2>Change Your Mind. Change Your Life.</h2>
    The mind is a very powerful muscle and like our arms and legs, the mind
    can be trained to serve us in the ways we need. The power of thought
    is under estimated but extremely resourceful in most any situation.
    Thinking positively can be a challenge when the dust is flying but 
    recalling simple techniques can get you through the storm.
    
    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
        <li>Watch Your Mouth :: <br> Common phrases like "I'm broke." or "I can't." reinforce
        a negative and incapable mindset.</li><br>
        
        <li>What Did You Expect :: <br> Do you expect the best? Or do you always
        think the worst is going to happen? Check your expectations
        for yourself and your life.</li><br>
        
        <li>Thoughts Become Things :: <br> "Thoughts become things" is a famous line from Mike Dooley and oh
        so true! Positive affirmations are a great way to create new
        thought habits. Repetition is key and these can go anywhere with you.</li>
    </ul>

 <br>
<h2>Love Your Body</h2> How you treat and carry your body is
very important. Do people with their arms crossed appear to be the most
helpful? No probably not. Their body language gives off closed energy
and so you likely seek the smiling woman on the platform to ask directions.
Take note of how you treat your body throughout the day. All habits
can be changed once we acknowledge them.

<ul style="list-style-type:none">
<li>Quench Your Life ::<br> The human body is made of about 60% of water and thus vital 
to our bodies' healthy operation. Drinking plenty of water keeps your body hydrated
and your mind fresh.</li><br>

<li>Breathe Through It ::<br> At any moment you feel yourself losing the ground 
below you or feel like you can't sort your thoughts .. take a breath.
Actually take five breaths in a five second inhale and five second exhale pattern.</li><br>

<li>Work it Out ::<br> The best way to exert energy, clear the head and show self-love
is by exercising. The activity of your choice will get the heart going
and can provide more clarity than you might expect.</li><br>

<li>LOOK UP ::<br> Where are your eyes when you walk? When your energy is low
are your eyes also hanging low? LOOK UP! It's a simple way to tell your
mind and heart that you are open to better.</li><br>

                            <!--SOUL-->

    <div id="soul_text"> <br> <h2>Spark Your Soul</h2>       <a id="soul_text2"></a>
    We exist as the combination of physical body and internal space which
    many call our soul. How is your soul? Do you feed your soul? Do you 
    make the best of every day or does time pass you quickly? What makes your
    soul feel good? What makes your soul feel bad? Knowking what serves your 
    growth <br>  and what hinders your growth are key to soul strengthening.

    <ul style="list-style-type:none">
    <li>Practice Makes  Happy :: <br> Meditation and yoga are two practices
    that can be explored daily. <br> The more you practice .. the happier your soul.</li><br>   
    
    <li>Say Thank You :: <br> Our mothers taught us manners, hopefully, but did 
    they teach you that gratefulness brings more of what you want? Even 
    when it feels like you want the world recognizing something as simple as the breeze will remind
    you that the world is full of pleasure and your dreams are already yours.</li> <br>   
    
    <li>Relieve the Pressure :: <br> Laugh at yourself. Laugh at life. Laugh at the
    tough times. Remember that nothing is usually as bad as it seems. And that in
    your life ... you create your destiny.</li><br>
    
    <li>Mention Intentions :: <br> Set intentions .. INTENTIONALLY. <br> Create a short
    list (1-3) of intentions to give your attention to in one week. And be sure to INTENTIONALLY think of 
    them throughout your day. Soon, these thoughts will be on auto-pilot and you can take
    note of your shift. And these thoughts can reveal your next steps.</li>
